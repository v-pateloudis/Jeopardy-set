This here is my very first project project to upload on GitHub. 

The data was taken from Codecademy's courses on the Machine Learning Specialist path. While primarily for educational purposes, the data is unedited. I have uploaded only a fraction of the dataset to remain within GitHub's file limit. 

The purpose of this project is mainly to showcase my ease at manipulating datasets.
